              You are psychically starved. <br />
              Each day you log in, you are looking and looking, seeking and
              seeking. <br />
              Something to make you feel more. Searching for something you want,
              yet you don't know what you want. <br />You give it names, unclear
              names. Money. Pleasure. Wealth. Lust. Love.<br />
              Something to make you feel more than you are now. <br />
              Yet you don't know what you mean by all that. You just feel a
              void.

              There is no NFT that will do that.

              The NFT scene today compels you to endlessly talk and share and
              shill for a one in a million chance to get on a list to maybe get
              an NFT.
              <br />
              It is not decent. It is not respectful.
              <br />
              It is making people grovel because they hope an NFT will
              psychically nourish them.
              <br />We all know this will never be enough.

              The loss of connection with the natural world is a threat to the
              well-being of individuals and society.
              <br />
              Whilst NFTs offer connection to people, most do not offer the
              possibility of reconnecting with the real world.

              This will be different.

              You, all humans, have a serious limitation: your intelligence is
              linear.
              <br />
              We examine the world in lines.
              <br />
              From the smart contract to education to much of understanding of
              our inner systems to that of the universe,
              <br />we have simply translated everything into signs, symbols,
              images to help us scan and understand.<br />
              But the universe does not come at us in lines.
              <br />
              It is multidimensional - a billion things all happening all at
              once in an instant.<br />
              The practical problems of your life deal with variables in the
              hundreds of thousands.

              <br />
              It has given us such technology as we have.

              But at the same time, it has proved too much of a good thing.
              <br />
              It has made us confused.
